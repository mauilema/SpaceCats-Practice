## Count Repeating Characters

### Given a string of letters, write a function that returns an array. Each element in the array must be a string composed of each character in the input string plus it's counter. 

### For example, the string "hello" should return the array ["h1", "e1", "l2", "o1"]. All the characters in "hello" appear once, except for the character "l". That is why it has a "2" next to it on the output array. 

### The input string cannot be empty. The output array should have all characters (when possible) in lowercase. You don't need to account for spaces in the output array.
